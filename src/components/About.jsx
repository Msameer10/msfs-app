            Welcome to MSFS App! This web app is designed to log and display details about my flights in Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br />

            <ul>
                <li>Flight routes</li>
                <li>Flight date (simulated)</li>
                <li>Aircraft used</li>
                <li>Flight name/number</li>
                <li>Distance</li>
                <li>Duration</li>
                <li>Cruise altitude</li>
            </ul> <br />
            The app is still a work in progress, and I plan to add more features and improvements as I continue learning and enhancing the functionality. Thanks for visiting!
